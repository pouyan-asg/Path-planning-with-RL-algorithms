# This problem is derived from "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" book by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton. This is a standard undiscounted, episodic task, with start and goal states and the usual actions causing movement up, down, Optimal path right, and left. The reward is -1 on all transitions except those into the region marked The Cliff. Stepping into this region incurs a reward of -100 and sends the agent instantly back to the start.
