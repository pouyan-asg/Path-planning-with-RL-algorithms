"The Temporal Difference (TD) method utilizes experience to address the prediction problem. Given experiences following a policy, this method updates its estimate, V, for the non-terminal states encountered in that experience. In this algorithm, actions are selected according to the policy. In each state, the agent randomly chooses an action based on a simple policy. When moving right encounters an obstacle, the agent will randomly select other actions, and this scenario applies similarly to other directions."
