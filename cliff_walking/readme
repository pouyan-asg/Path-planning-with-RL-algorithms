This problem is adapted from the book 'Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction' by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton. It represents a standard, undiscounted, episodic task with designated start and goal states. The available actions include moving up, down, right, and left. The default reward is -1 for all transitions except those leading into the region marked 'The Cliff.' Entering this region results in a penalty of -100 and instantaneously relocates the agent back to the start.
